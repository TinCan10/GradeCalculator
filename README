Hi @everyone, with assignment 3 starting we should get ready for the programming section. For this assignment, there are three main functions that I believe need to happen for the code:
1 – There needs to be a function to calculate the grade and alter the student’s final grade using the score that the student enters.
2 – When a user opens the application for the first time, there will be a single bar asking them to add an assignment, max points, grade weight, and their score. We need a function add a new bar each time the student enters in information about the assignment (and maybe an error message if they do not finish entering information about the previous assignment).
3 – There should be a function to save and load a student’s grade, so they do not have to re-enter everything each time they use the software. This will probably go to a text file since its only a prototype, but I want to at least provide a way to export the student’s score somehow (if we can’t add the score back into the software it’s no problem).
Make sure to add any file to the GitHub page that I linked earlier in the server, once everything is ready we can make a recording of the software and send it to the professor on Friday. If anyone needs help with JavaScript, here is the link to some documentation for it: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript

7/19/22 - I just finished function 2 to add more assignments. It is currently a button.

7/21/22 - I just added function 1 to the bar.js file.
